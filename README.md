# Glass-Jar-Ornament

We make sea glass ornaments that are lit using gently pulsating colored LED lights to give a pleasant kinetic light effect. 
We can demonstrate how the ornaments are made using two glass jars and how the Arduino device that drives the lights is 
programmed. Our design is open source. This is the source code.
